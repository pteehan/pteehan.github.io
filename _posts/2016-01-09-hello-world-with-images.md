This blog uses Jekyll and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with content authored using RMarkdown.  I'm indebted to Barry Clark for creating [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), and Nicole White for [working out a good process](http://nicolewhite.github.io/2015/02/07/r-blogging-with-rmarkdown-knitr-jekyll.html) for publishing RMarkdown to a Jekyll blog.  

Here is the 'cars' dataset from R, to show that images are working.
