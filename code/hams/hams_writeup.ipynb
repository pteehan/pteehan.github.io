    "We are asked to solve the following task:\n",
    "* Two listings of product-session pairs are provided; one for search results, and one for viewings.\n",
    "* For each product that was viewed, find which three products are most often viewed or displayed in the same session.\n",
    "\n",
    "I interpret this as follows.  Suppose a product appears in $m$ sessions across both datasets.  For each session, we should collect the list of other products that also appeared in that session, either viewed or displayed, so that we have a full set of products associated with that session.  Then, across each of these $m$ sessions, we should identify the three products that appeared in the most number of sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I approach this problem by constructing a similarity matrix where the value of each cell $(i,j)$ is the number of times product $i$ appeared in a session that also included product $j$.  The matrix is square with each dimension equal to the total number of unique products that were either viewed or displayed.  For example, consider a scenario with four products 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', across three sessions, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Session 1: 'a', 'b', 'c'\n",
    "    Session 2: 'b', 'c', 'd'\n",
    "    Session 3: 'c', 'd'\n",
    "\n",
    "The similarity matrix is 4 x 4 and has the following values:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [1 1 1 0\n",
    "     1 2 2 1\n",
    "     1 2 3 2\n",
    "     0 1 2 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagonal entries record the total number of times each product appears.  The most frequently co-occuring products can be identified by reading off each row.  For example, the third row corresponds to product 'c' and has entires [1, 2, 3, 2].  This indicates that across all sessions that included 'c', 'a' appeared once, 'b' twice, 'c' three times, and 'd' twice.  To solve the problem, we need to construct the full similarity matrix, and then for each product, identify the three highest occuring products.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote a class to handle constructing and populating the matrix and returning the output in a useful form.  Here is the example output for product 12: "
