I'm a professional data scientist with a software engineering and research background.  I have several years experience using R to analyze data and build data products.  This website hosts my personal projects.  

### Technical details

This site is hosted in Github Pages and uses Jekyll; specifically, it uses the [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) template created by Barry Clark.  All content is written in R using R Markdown and is published following a process similar to the one developed by [Nicole White](http://nicolewhite.github.io/2015/02/07/r-blogging-with-rmarkdown-knitr-jekyll.html).  You can view the source code for all of my posts on my [Github account](https://github.com/pteehan/pteehan.github.io/tree/master/_drafts).
