I'm a professional data scientist with a strong software engineering background.  I have several years experience using R to analyze data and build data products.  This website hosts my personal projects.  

### Technical details

This site is hosted in Github Pages and uses Jekyll; specifically, it uses the [https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now](Jekyll Now) template created by Barry Clark.  All content is written in R using R Markdown and is published following a process similar to the one developed by [http://nicolewhite.github.io/2015/02/07/r-blogging-with-rmarkdown-knitr-jekyll.html](Nicole White).  You can view the source code for all of my posts on my [https://github.com/pteehan/pteehan.github.io/tree/master/_drafts](Github account).
